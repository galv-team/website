## What is it?

Battery science is a complex field.
You'll have collected a lot of data on a lot of different cells, probably of different types.
You'll probably have used a variety of equipment to collect that data.
And all that data might be in many different formats.

Galv helps you manage all that complexity.
It helps you keep track of the cells you've used, the equipment you've used, and the schedules you've run.
It helps you package all that data and metadata together, and it helps you keep track of how it all fits together.

When it's time to collaborate, share, or publish your work, Galv is there for you.
Collaborate and share resources within Galv immediately, or export your data and metadata in a format that's easy to share with others and archive for publication.
